		# DenApp
This is a project by debber1. It started out as a small app for a local sports club, but quickly grew to be my biggest project to date. 

# A few things to note:
- This project was started a long time ago, when I did not know what I was doing. As a result, it has a lot of inconsistencies and bad coding practices. I know this and have already fixed the worst one's (believe me, it was bad).
- This project was started before flyout pages were a thing. As a result, it uses masterdetail, which is *not* the recommended way to do this anymore.
- The original language of this project was Dutch. I tried to change most names and classes to English, but the views unfortunately kept their original name. 
- This project is complete for me. It is not done (projects are never done) but it is complete.
- The mysql server and php pages used in this project are not opensource. This is because they are not the most secure things in the world. In the future I might try to fix this.
- If you have any questions or remarks, feel free to make an issue about it.
